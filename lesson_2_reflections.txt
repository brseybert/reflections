# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Creates a .git file in the directory. Need to do it so you can make commits, etc.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is files that are done for the time being (you think) and ready to be committed. The working directory is for files that are currently being worked on and not ready to be committed. The benefit is it gives you a way to "logically" separate or partition files or groups of files so that you can maintain an organized repository.

# How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You can see whether the files in the staging area are related to each other within a logical change?

# What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Any time you are making a major change would be a good time to add a branch. I see this as equivalent to "save as" in Microsoft Word or another document editor type program.

# How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Help show how branches connect back to master and which are reachable, etc.
