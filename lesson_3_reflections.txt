### Keywords/Questions
#### When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working with collaborators, I could see it would be almost necessary. Also if working across multiple machines.

#### Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The remote repository could be shared in which case it might not be me who makes the changes to remote repository. Or there could be multiple people working on the same file that will both be uploaded to the remote repository.
